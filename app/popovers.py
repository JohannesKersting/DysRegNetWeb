                **Minimum dysregulation fraction:**
                Allows to filter the displayed regulations by the fraction of patients they are dysregulated in.
                Only edges with an equal to or larger fraction of dysregulated patients will be displayed in the network
                graph.
                
                **Maximum regulations displayed:** 
                Sets a cutoff for the maximum number of regulations displayed in 
                the network graph. Therefore, regulations get sorted by their fraction of dysregulated patients. 
                Regulations, which are disregulated in only few patients, will be dropped first. Due to the upper 
                limit, it is only possible to graphically inspect the 200 topmost dysregulated edges. 
                
                **Scale node size by:**
                Scale the size of displayed genes/nodes by the fraction of patients they are
                mutated in or their mean promoter methylation across patients. Nodes with missing data are displayed
                with reduced opacity.
                 
                **Display nodes:**
                Filter the nodes/genes, so that either only target or only source nodes of the query genes are
                displayed.

                ##### Compare options
                **Compare to cancer type:**
                Compare the dysregulation fractions of currently displayed regulations to the corresponding ones in a
                different cancer type.
                
                **Display dysregulation difference:**
                Toggles, whether the difference between the dysregulation fractions should be visualized as 
                colored bars on the edges. A orange bar means, that the primary selected cancer type has a higher
                dysregulation fraction than the type compared to. A green bar means a lower dysregulation fraction.
                Even if the feature is toggled off, the exact differences can still be inspected by clicking directly on
                a regulation.
                
                NOTE: Any filtering of the regulations will still be based on the dysregulation fraction of the primary
                selected cancer type, not on its difference to the compared type.

                A query genes outgoing edges are considered target regulations, incoming edges source regulations. 
                For both types the first number corresponds to the amount of currently displayed edges, the second to 
                the total number including edges which were removed by filtering or by exceeding the maximum number of
                displayable edges. 
                
                NOTE: The combined values of both categories (source/target regulations) won't necessarily sum up to the
                total number of edges, since a connection between two query genes is included in both.

                Load a heatmap to visualize patient-specific dysregulation. Each row corresponds to a
                patient, each column to a regulation in the currently displayed network graph. The value of a cell is
                an absolute z-value, which was used to categorize a regulation in a patient as dysregulated. The higher
                the value, the more significant is the dysregulation. Hovering over a cell will yield the exact z-value.
                Cells with missing z-values are considered conventionally regulated. For the clustering they are treated as 
                zeros, even though in reality their z-values are just below a threshold.
