                **Minimum dysregulation fraction:**
                Allows to filter the displayed regulations by the fraction of patients they are dysregulated in.
                Only edges with an equal to or larger fraction of dysregulated patients will be displayed in the network
                graph.
                
                **Maximum regulations displayed:** 
                Sets a cutoff for the maximum number of regulations displayed in 
                the network graph. Therefore, regulations get sorted by their fraction of dysregulated patients. 
                Regulations, which are disregulated in only few patients, will be dropped first. Due to the upper 
                limit, it is only possible to graphically inspect the 200 topmost dysregulated edges. 
                
                **Scale node size by:**
                Scale the size of displayed genes/nodes by the fraction of patients they are
                mutated in or their mean promoter methylation across patients. Nodes with missing data are displayed
                with reduced opacity.
                 
                **Display nodes:**
                Filter the nodes/genes, so that either only target or only source nodes of the query genes are
                displayed.

                **Compare to cancer type:**
                Compare the dysregulation fractions of currently displayed regulations to the corresponding ones in a
                different cancer type.
                
                **Display dysregulation difference:**
                Toggles, whether the difference between the dysregulation fractions should be visualized as 
                colored bars on the edges. A orange bar means, that the primary selected cancer type has a higher
                dysregulation fraction than the type compared to. A green bar means a lower dysregulation fraction.
                Even if the feature is toggled off, the exact differences can still be inspected by clicking directly on
                a regulation.
                
                NOTE: Any filtering of the regulations will still be based on the dysregulation fraction of the primary
                selected cancer type, not on its difference to the compared type.

                Load a heatmap to visualize patient-specific dysregulation. Each row corresponds to a
